	<h2>About Course</h2>
	<p>Front-end web development is the development of the
 	graphical user interface of a website, through the use of 
	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and 
	interact with that website.With continuing development 
	for mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, 
	designers need to ensure that their site comes up correctly
	 in browsers on all devices. This can be done by creating a
	 responsive web design using stylesheets in CSS.</p>
