    <h1 style="color: brown;">Welcome to My Full-Stack Course</h1>
    <p>Full-stack developers are the jack of all trades of the industry. 
        They know about everything, making them the most versatile and probably the 
         useful kind of professional in the industry</p>
    <p>
        The path to becoming a full stack developer will take time. It's not only about learning various front-end
         and backend technologies. It's also about understanding those two areas in more detail and making communication
         between those two areas easy and smooth. So you need to have plenty of patience to get there </p>
